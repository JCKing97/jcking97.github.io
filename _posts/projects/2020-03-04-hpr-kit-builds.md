        The Harwell Rocket Club is relatively new, but already has a good amount of people designing and building rockets for the Red Kite project. As I joined late and interest has been growing, we are aiming to set up another team, building in parallel to the Red Kite series. As a sort of "onboarding" idea we decided it would be best to start by building HPR kits - similar to the first rockets that the Red Kite team built. The aim is to create a learning platform for those joining with no experience in rocketry such as myself and to increase the number of certified rocketeers for more ambitious projects later on.
