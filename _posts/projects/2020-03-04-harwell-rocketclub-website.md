        A group in the same graduate scheme as me at the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) have started up a rocketry club. Space and space technology is one of my great interests and when I heard about it I had to join! As part of this I signed up to creating a website and helping build a media presence for the Harwell Rocket Club. The website is a static site hosted on GitHub pages and created with Jekyll. It can be found at <a href="https://www.harwellrocketclub.com">harwellrocketclub.com</a>.
