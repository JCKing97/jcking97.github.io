        I have been interested in cooking for a long time. My first job was cooking in a Waitrose partner dining room which allowed me to experiment by creating menus with access to a wide range of ingredients from the store itself and the use of fantastic equipment (including a combi oven!). Since having gone to university this drive to explore new tastes and find new dishes has not waned. For a long time I have wanted a place to record the recipes I have created or used. This is partly for future use myself, but also for others to explore if they so wish. This website has given me that opportunity, you can see that start of it here: <a href="{{ 'recipes#navbar' | relative_url }}">jcking97.github.io/recipes</a>. I hope to have the chance to practice more and create more of my own flavours.
