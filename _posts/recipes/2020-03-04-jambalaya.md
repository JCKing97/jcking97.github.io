        This recipe has been copied from <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/chicken-chorizo-jambalaya">BBC Good Food</a> I take no credits (except for minor alterations), but I love it and want to share it. The New Orleans rice dish has been a staple for me over the last few years and is a home cooked meal that always makes me happy. I also wanted to record it in case it magically disappeared from the BBC site.

## Preparation

You can interleave the preparation with the process, but that's up to you at cook time. I find that dicing the chicken and chorizo first is a must, the rest you can interleave.

1. Dice the chicken breast
1. Remove the skin and dice the Chorizo if you haven't managed to find it diced
1. Dice the onion
1. Crush the garlic
1. Thinly slice the red pepper
1. Combine the stock with the water early (it can take a few minutes to mix nicely)

## Process:

1. Heat the oil in either a large (deep) frying pan or alternatively I find a large saucepan works and cook the chicken until sealed (roughly 5 mins)
1. Add the diced onion and cook till soft (around 3 mins)
1. Add the prepared red pepper, garlic, chorizo and the Cajun. Cook for 5 more minutes to get the flavour of the Cajun, garlic and chorizo to pop. Ensuring to mix the mixture together and avoid the ingredients catching and burning.
1. Add the chopped tomatoes, rice and chicken stock. Cover and simmer for roughly 20-25 minutes until the rice is tender and the dish has thickened, if you ned to add more water do it! Ensure the mixture doesn't stick by stirring regularly and from the bottom of the pan.

That's it, really simple and tasty!

I totally want one of the pans below to cook it in!
