Similar recipes comes up across many east asian cuisines. This is a dark rich sauce that is best complimented with lighter ingredients. My favourite way to use the recipe is to stick it to vegetarian chicken alternatives and serve on a bed of rice with steamed broccoli and other veg.

## Ingredients

### Sauce

- Brown sugar
- Soy sauce
- Ground Ginger
- 3 x Garlic cloves
- 1 x Fresh Chilli or teaspoon of crushed chillis
- Sweet chilli sauce
- Honey
- Sesame seeds
- Cornflour
- Oyster Sauce

### Suggestions

- Diced chicken or vegetarian alternative (Plant Pioneer chicken pieces from Sainsburys worked really well!)
- Cashew nuts or Peanuts
- Chopped Spring (green) onions
- Long grain or Jasmin Rice
- Broccoli and/or any other steamed veg you enjoy 


## Process

1. If uncooked grill the cashews/peanuts (be careful they don't burn they don't take long!)
2. Fry the chicken/pieces in oil or cook whatever alternative you choose
3. Steam the veg and cook the rice in parallel to this but delat a few minutes in the starting so everything is ready at the same time
4. Once mostly cooked add the garlic, chilli and ginger to the chicken and fry for a couple of minutes
5. Go ahead and add the rest of the sauce ingredients 
6. Continue cooking until the sauce has thickened and is all nice and sticky with the chicken pieces
7. Once all finished plate up the rice and put the sticky chicken on top
8. Sprinkle the nuts and spring onions onto the sticky chicken and serve the steamed veg on the side
