## Process

1. If uncooked grill the cashews/peanuts (be careful they don't burn they don't take long!)
2. Fry the chicken/pieces in oil or cook whatever alternative you choose
3. Steam the veg and cook the rice in parallel to this but delat a few minutes in the starting so everything is ready at the same time
4. Once mostly cooked add the garlic, chilli and ginger to the chicken and fry for a couple of minutes
5. Go ahead and add the rest of the sauce ingredients 
6. Continue cooking until the sauce has thickened and is all nice and sticky with the chicken pieces
7. Once all finished plate up the rice and put the sticky chicken on top
8. Sprinkle the nuts and spring onions onto the sticky chicken and serve the steamed veg on the side
