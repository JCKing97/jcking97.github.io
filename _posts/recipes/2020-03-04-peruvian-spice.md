This spice mix comes straight out of peru with the earthiness of cumin, the heat of chilli and the sharpness of lime. I like to cook it into sweet potato wedges and fajitas, which I will describe how to do here, but it works with virtually any south american food.

With this recipe we'll make the spice mix first and then I'll give you a couple of suggested uses.

## Process

1. Fry the onions in oil until three quarters cooked
2. Add the garlic, lime, coriander, cumin, chilli, oregano and continue to fry for a couple of minutes

## Sweet Potato Wedges 

### Process

1. Peel and then chop the sweet potato into wedges
2. In a pan or pyrex dish mix the wedges and cooked spices with a bit of oil
3. Roast for around 20 mins (to crisp them up grill for a bit)

## Fajitas

### Process

1. Fry the chicken or veggie alternative until sealed
2. Add in the pepper and spice mix with a bit of oil and cook until the chicken is golden on the outside and cooked all the way through
3. Serve by putting the fried ingredients onto tortillas dishing the salsa on top and rolling up
