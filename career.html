        <h3>Experimental Controls</h3>

        <p>
            I am currently working in an agile devops team enabling instrument scientists and users of the ISIS facility to control experiments.
            The ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Source is a world leading research facility run by the Science and Technology Facilities Council that uses particle physics to study materials at the atomic level.
            We collaborate on EPICS (the Experimental Physics Industrial Control System) and use the technologies produced by it to build the IBEX control system.
            Besides EPICS we use a number of languages including Java, Python and C++ as well as various technologies when developing IBEX.

            IBEX employs client-server architecture and a number of components to facilitate smooth control of experiments.
            I have worked on a number of components of IBEX, leading the development of some. 
            One of these components is the script generator. Scientists can use our Python library (genie_python) to script experiments.
            Many of these scripted experiments follow a similar template. 
            Along with others, I have led the development of the script generator which simplifies the production of scripts.
            The script generator takes a script definition (the template) and allows users to input the parameters for a specific experiment.
            A script is then generated and can be used to control an experiment.
            I have also worked on the development and maintenance of other components such as IOCs (input-output controller software) to control cryogenic kit, vacuum tank equipment and magnets.
            Furthermore, I am involved in the operation of the software including deployments and instrument migrations.

        <h3>Computer Science at Royal Holloway, University of London</h3>
        <p>
            I graduated with a BSc in Computer Science from Royal Holloway in 2019 with the highest grade in my cohort.
            As part of my studies I honed my skills as a software engineer studying the tools, techniques, processes and perspectives that facilitate intelligent production of software.
            For my third year project I studied Cooperative Strategies in Multi-Agent Systems. 
            In this project I delved into the background of the development of intelligent agents and multi-agent systems, developed a framework called the nature engine for the study of cooperative strategies in multi-agent systems and evaluated the success of agent strategies in facilitiating stable cooperation in societies.
            The study of intelligent agents, multi-agent systems and machine learning as well as other techniques allowed me to develop a breadth and depth of knowledge in possibly the most interesting field of our time artificial intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            I found during this time that I delighted in learning, especially when studying the application of computational techniques such as graph theory and clustering to the beautiful field of biology in bioinformatics. 
            Further to these fields, I found algorithms and complexity, and functional programming to be topics of great interest and gained an appreciation for cyber security and project management.
            During my time at university I learnt and employed a number of languages and technologies including some of those listed below.
