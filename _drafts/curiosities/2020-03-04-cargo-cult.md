        The cargo cults are an interesting phenomena generally occurring in the pacific islands. I have read about them in David Attenborough's book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40530691-journeys-to-the-other-side-of-the-world">"Journey to the Other Side of the World"</a>.

The cults come as a consequence of western expansion into the pacific islands and focus around the idea that the native islanders will be blessed with precious cargo. Cargo usually refers to the technology that westerners bring with them such as radios, fridges etc.
